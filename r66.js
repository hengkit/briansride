It is a National Civil Engineering Landmark, a National Scenic Byway, and the first of just two California Historic Parkways (the other being S.R. 163 through Balboa Park in San Diego). In 2011, the Parkway and associated features were listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the Arroyo Seco Parkway Historic District. Also of interest is N. Figueroa St., which parallels much of the Parkway just to the west. Figueroa carried the previous alignment of Route 66 beginning in 1931, and after completion of the Parkway was Alternate 66. This is the main street of downtown Highland Park (a district of Los Angeles) with destinations associated with Route 66 to visit and explore.  Traveling both today provides telling views of two different historical experiences along the Mother Road in Los Angeles and the Arroyo Seco region of Southern California.",
